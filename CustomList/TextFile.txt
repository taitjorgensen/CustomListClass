The - operator overload was used to remove all repeated entries found in ListTwo from ListOne.
Whenever a match is found within the CustomList class, it is excluded from being added to the NewList.
The NewList is written only when the compareValue from ListTwo finds no matches in ListOne.

The - operator overload examines what type 'T' the list is, modifies each index 'ToString', then
uses a bool to determine a match.

After the index is passed through the 'for loop' looking for a match it is Added to the NewList.
If a match is found, that index is exluded from being Added.

This in effect removes the item, when in reality is merely 'not adding' or skipping the item.
